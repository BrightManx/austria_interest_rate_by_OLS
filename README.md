# Austria's Interest Rate by OLS  
This captivating assignment, undertaken as a group work during my econometrics course, aimed at estimating Austria's interest rate using robust statistical techniques.  
Through the application of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and the insights provided by Taylor's rule, I delved into the intricate world of economics to retrieve the required macroeconomics indicators and successfully estimated Austriaâ€™s interest rate, as well as carefully performed essential diagnostic checks on the obtained results to ensure their reliability and accuracy.
