# ðŸ“ˆ Austria's Interest Rate by OLS  
This is an assignment undertaken as a group work for the econometrics course of my BSc. 

The goal is to estimate Austria's interest rate through the application of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and the insights provided by Taylor's rule.

After retrieving the required macroeconomics, we  successfully estimated Austriaâ€™s interest rate and finally performed essential diagnostic checks to ensure reliability, robustness and accuracy.
